
My own project is contained in the file

Statistical_Inference_Project.Rmd

codebook_gss.htm contains the explanation of what is in the dataset gss

All the other R files contain the definition of a function used in main R file.

All the graphs are stored in the pdf files and in the comments in main R file
there is a reference to which file to open if you want to see the graph 
without running the R code
